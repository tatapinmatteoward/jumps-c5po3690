# Mastering Court Vision: Insights from the 2023 NBA Finals

The 2023 NBA Finals between the Denver Nuggets and the Miami Heat wasn't just a clash of titans; it was a clinic in court vision. At CourtVision Daily, we're obsessed with dissecting those intangible skills that separate the greats from the legends. Today, let's zoom in on Jalen Brunson and Jamal Murray—two point guards whose ability to read the floor turned potential chaos into orchestrated masterpieces.

## What is Court Vision, Anyway?

Court vision is more than just passing; it's anticipation. It's seeing the defense's seams before they tighten, predicting teammate movements, and turning a fast break into a highlight-reel assist. In the Finals, this skill was on full display, with Murray's no-look dimes to Nikola Jokić proving pivotal in Denver's championship run.

Consider Game 5: With the Heat's zone defense clamping down, Murray scanned the court in a split second. He spotted Jokić's cut to the rim and delivered a threading-the-needle pass that evaded Jimmy Butler's outstretched arms. That's court vision at its finest—turning defense into points with surgical precision.

## Brunson's Heat Vision

On the other side, Jalen Brunson brought his own flair. Though the Heat fell short, Brunson's vision kept Miami in contention. In Game 3, facing a Nuggets team up 2-0, Brunson orchestrated a comeback with vision passes that exploited Denver's help defense. One standout play: a skip pass to Max Strus for a corner three after drawing two defenders. Brunson's ability to elevate his teammates under pressure is why he's a rising star.

## Data Dive: Vision Metrics

Stats don't lie. Using advanced tracking data from CourtVision tools, Murray ranked in the 95th percentile for potential assists per game, while Brunson hit the 92nd. These aren't just numbers; they're proof of how vision translates to wins. In the playoffs, teams with high court vision indices (like Denver's 1.12) outscored opponents by 8.4 points per 100 possessions.

## Lessons for Aspiring Guards
